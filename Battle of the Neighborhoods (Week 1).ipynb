These two sections will include a description of the problem and background discussion along with a data description and the way it will be used to solve the chosen problem. "

            "source": "Rock climbing, as the name implies, is a sport in which people ascend natural rock formations with the goal of completing a preset route that terminates at an anchor point or any other indicator of the route end. There are two main categories of rock climbing: aid climbing and free climbing. The main difference lies in the usage of mechanical assistance. Free climbing includes bouldering, soloing, sport, and traditional climbing. Personally, I started rock climbing in the winter of 2016. Being from a city in Northern British Columbia, this gym proved to be a great addition to the community as the outdoor climbing locations are covered with snow for approximately half of the year. Indoor climbing gyms are great additions to cities and towns for many reasons. The gyms provide a place for beginner climbers to try the sport in a controlled environment while more advanced climbers have a place to train and improve their skills in the colder seasons of the year. Due to the creation of the gym in my hometown, I started to think of larger cities across the country where this type of facility would be feasible. After this consideration, I decided to focus on the city of Vancouver, British Columbia."

With a population of 675 200 as of 2017, the city is consistently ranked as having a high livability rating despite having the most expensive housing market in the nation. During my preliminary research for a problem to solve for this project, I noticed that there were numerous traditional fitness facilities located across the city (e.g. strength and weight training). However, I noticed that there were few alternative fitness options (e.g. rock climbing facilities) that were available to the public in a city the size of Vancouver. The facilities that are already present in this city are located very far apart. For this project, I have decided to determine where the best area of Vancouver, Britsh Columbia to open a rock climbing gym. Numerous factors will be taken into account in order to provide a proper solution to this problem."

Due to the fact that I was not able to find a very recent data set that showed the population of Vanvouver as split by population, I decided to also use Fousquare data in order to bolster the effectiveness of the location assessment. The neighborhood population data found was from 2011. The additional Foursquare data will we used to try and gauge the amount of traffic that the venues in the same area experience. More venues in the area can be indicative of more potential people that would be interested in visiting a new business. In addition to being used to assess location traffic, Foursquare data will also be used in order to assess the potential level of competition. The business competition level will be dependent upon the number of similar venues that are located in the same area. Venues that are not of the same type can prove to be beneficial as they may be of interest to people who would otherwise not have attended such a gym had one not been present in their area. to many cultural and post-secondary institutions. Vancouver crime data from 2019 will be used to assess the safety of the potential location of the rock climbing gym. This data set contains the number of criminal offences committed in each neighborhood. Furthermore, this dataset is also segmented into the types of crime that have occurred. This consideration is especially important because potential patrons will not visit the business unless they do not feel safe in the area. Lastly, the real estate data will be used in order to gauge the potential property cost. This will only provide the potential stakeholders with a portion of the initial startup cost. Other potential startup costs would include contracting services and climbing equipment among others.  \n\nData Source Links\n\n1.)
